    <h1>Web design</h1>
    <p>Web design is a creative process that involves planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content intended for the internet. It goes beyond aesthetics to include the website's overall functionality. Web design incorporates several elements such as layout, colors, graphics, fonts, and content, all of which come together to create a user experience. Good web design is user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. With the rise of mobile use, responsive design has become a crucial part of web design, ensuring that websites maintain their integrity across various devices. As a field, web design is always evolving and requires continual learning and adaptation to keep up with technology trends.</p>
