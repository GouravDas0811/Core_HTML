    <h1>Web development</h1>
    <p>Web development is a dynamic field that involves creating websites or web applications. It encompasses several aspects including web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, and network security configuration. Web developers use various programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and others to build the structure, design, and functionality of a website. The process can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, or social network services. As the internet continues to grow, web development has become increasingly important and popular, making it a highly sought-after skill in the digital age.</p>
